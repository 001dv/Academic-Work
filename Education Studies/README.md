# Group Project: EDS 112 - Educational Mishaps in the Midwest

## Project Overview
This research project offers an in-depth analysis of the educational landscape in Columbus, OH and its surrounding areas, Dublin and Sunbury, focusing on various demographic and economic indicators. The study reveals stark differences in racial composition, educational achievement, and economic conditions among these regions.
The project explores several underlying factors that contribute to these disparities, such as teacher experience, chronic absenteeism, and curriculum relevance. Additionally, it examines how external factors like poverty and stress influence educational outcomes. The study utilizes data points, literature, and film references to argue for the incorporation of socially linked services in urban schools to improve educational outcomes.

My contributions included:

- **Economic Demographic Analysis:** Conducted a comprehensive evaluation of the economic conditions in the targeted regions, including income levels and poverty rates.
- **District Data Compilation:** Assembled key data points for each school district, encompassing enrollment figures, proficiency scores, and graduation rates.
- **School District Demographics:** Analyzed the demographic makeup of each school district, focusing on racial composition and age groups.
- **Editing Presentation for Cohesion:** Edited the final presentation to ensure a cohesive flow and logical structure, enhancing the clarity and impact of our findings.
- **Picking the Research Topic:** Initiated the research project by selecting a topic that aligned with the teamâ€™s collective expertise and interest, setting the direction for the entire study.
