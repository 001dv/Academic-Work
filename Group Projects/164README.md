# Group Project: COGS 164 - Motivation of Cannabis Use

## Project Overview
This research project seeks to explore how individual motivations influence the selection of specific cannabis strains among college students and the subsequent impact on emotional regulation. Utilizing two different surveys, the study tests the hypothesis that students who prefer Sativa strains over Indica are likely to experience higher levels of emotional dysregulation.


My contributions included:

- **Research Question Drafting:** Formulated the research question focusing on how individual motivation affects cannabis strain selection and emotional regulation.
- **Organizing Team Meetings:** Scheduled and led regular team meetings, ensuring effective communication and progress tracking for project milestones.
- **Editing & Creating Presentation Template:** 	Designed a cohesive presentation template for consistency and aesthetics, while also editing content to maintain a polished and professional look.
- **Presenting Research Background:** Delivered the project presentation, clearly articulating the research question, hypothesis, and background information to stakeholders.

Thank you for taking the time to review this project!

Best regards,
